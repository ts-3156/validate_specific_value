# validate_specific_value

This is a way to validate single attribute in Rails. :tada:

Sometimes there are validations that are quite expensive (e.g. validations that need to perform database queries). In that case you need to avoid using valid? because it simply does a lot more than you need. [link](https://stackoverflow.com/questions/4804591/rails-activerecord-validate-single-attribute)

- accessor methods

## Getting Started

Add this line to your applicationâ€™s Gemfile:

```ruby
gem 'validate_specific_value'
```

Add a validation rule to your model.

```ruby
validates :name, uniqueness: true
```

And use:

```ruby
class User < ApplicationRecord
  validates_specific :name
end
```

The first value will be the initial value. This gives you:

#### Accessor Methods

Instance context:

```ruby
user = User.new(name: 'duplicate_name')
user.valid_name?
# => false

user.errors[:name]
# => ["has already been taken"]

```

Class context:

```ruby
User.valid_name?('duplicate_name')
# => false
```
